Copy the page title and URL as rich text.

Useful for pasting links to Slack, Google Docs, etc.

## Usage

Click the extension icon or execute the keyboard shortcut to copy the link to the page as rich text.

## Keyboard shortcut

The default keyboard shortcut is Ctrl + Shift + L, and Command + Shift + L on Mac.
This can be changed from the browser's extension settings.

## Plain text fallback

As a fallback, we also copy in plain text format in the form `"{title}" {url}`,
so that if you paste where rich text is not available or paste explicitly as plain text (Ctrl + Shift + V on Windows), this plain text format will be pasted.
